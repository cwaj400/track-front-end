**Description**

During my period of moving freelance to full-time, I learned React Native. Although I used React & React Native back in college in 2018, it was relatively new and I spent more time learning AngularIO instead (which is what I used for my final project).

In this project, I built a simple mobile app which leverages `axios`, `node.js` (for the back end, source code for back end here: https://github.com/cwaj400/rn-track-server), `express`, and `mongo`.
The app allows users to log in, or register for an account (password data is hashed and stored in mongodb). User can then add a new navigation object, where their movement is tracked. This data is then stored in an array of cords and saved in mongo. The user can then re-render this data in a list of places they've been.
